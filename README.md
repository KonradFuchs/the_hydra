## *"Cut off one head and two more will take its place!"*

Hydra is a simple virus that displays a message box. When you close a message box, 2 more will show up.

This virus was implemented using ***Visual Basic*** and ***.NET 4.7.1***.

This virus is harmless ðŸ™‚ If you know how to make it more annoying (for example: Task Manager can't shut it down), feel free to contact me

# *HAIL HYDRA!*
