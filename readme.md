## *"Cut off one head, two more shall take its place!"*

Hydra is a Windows virus that displays a message box. When you close a message box, 2 more will show up.

This virus was implemented using ***Visual Basic*** and ***.NET 4.7.1***.

Demo: https://youtu.be/2Nk8loSs02c

Note that this virus is harmless ðŸ™‚ If you know how to make it more annoying (for example: Task Manager can't shut it down), feel free to contact me

(so that means Task Manager is Captain America ðŸ¤”)

# *HAIL HYDRA!*
